# TaxServiceDB

## Overview
The TaxServiceDB project is focused on creating and managing a synthetic tax database using Python and SQL. The project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook named `TaxServiceDB.ipynb` to generate synthetic datasets and a `TaxServiceDB.txt` file containing SQL queries that demonstrate various operations on these datasets.

## Workflow
1. **Synthetic Dataset Creation**:
   - The `TaxServiceDB.ipynb` notebook uses the `Faker` library, along with Pythonâ€™s `random` and `pandas`, to create the following synthetic datasets:
     - `synthetic_taxpayer_data.csv`
     - `synthetic_income_data.csv`
     - `synthetic_deductions_data.csv`
     - `synthetic_filing_data.csv`
     - `synthetic_payment_data.csv`

2. **SQL Commands**:
   - The `TaxServiceDB01.txt` file contains a series of SQL commands executed to manipulate and analyze the synthetic data, including:
     - **Joins**:
       - Combining tables to retrieve taxpayer, income, and deduction information.
     - **Aggregation**:
       - Calculating total income, total deductions, and taxable income for each taxpayer.
     - **Conditional Logic**:
       - Applying tax rate calculations based on taxable income thresholds.
     - **Views**:
       - Creating views for summarized taxpayer data.
     - **Transactions**:
       - Demonstrating transaction control with `START TRANSACTION`, `UPDATE`, and `COMMIT`.
     - **Indexes**:
       - Creating indexes to optimize query performance.
     - **String and Date Functions**:
       - Using functions to manipulate taxpayer information, including age calculations and eligibility recommendations.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Run the `TaxServiceDB.ipynb` notebook to create the synthetic datasets.
2. **Explore SQL Commands**: Review the `TaxServiceDB01.txt` file to understand the SQL operations performed on the datasets.
